Hi, thanks for checking out my stuff.

This is the dataset associated with the evaluation in my OOPSLA 2016 paper, "Stateless Model Checking with Data-Race Preemption Points". You can read the paper here:

    http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/associated/oopsla.pdf

and find other associated materials here:

The spreadsheet is also available on google docs for easier browsing:

Each of the first 6 sheets corresponds to one of the data series in figures 7 and 8 in the paper. The last two sheets belong to figure 9.

Feel free to email me (first author email in the paper) with any questions, comments, or compliments.

Ben
